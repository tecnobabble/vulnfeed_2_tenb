# VulnFeed 2 Tenb

VulnFeed 2 Tenb is a way to parse vulnerability data from Cyber Advisory Feeds into Tenable.sc.

This is not supported by Tenable.

## Installation

### Docker Image

Use the pre-built docker image

```bash
docker pull tecnobabble/vulnfeed_2_tenb:latest
```

### Manually Build Docker Image

1. Clone the GitHub repository to an empty folder on your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tecnobabble/vulnfeed_2_tenb.git .
```
2. Build the container
```bash
docker build -t vulnfeed_2_tenb .
```

### Local Configuration
Setup your local .env file with the appropriate tenable.sc attributes (replace the attributes below with the ones specific to your environment).

```bash
SC_ADDRESS=10.0.0.102
SC_ACCESS_KEY=89b0aa234237ec13b06da8283919c0f7
SC_SECRET_KEY=8360bf971eb9a1e488d294d830a24eba
SC_PORT=8443
```

#### Configuration Notes:
* SC_ADDRESS can be an IP or hostname.
* SC_PORT is optional; defaults to 443.
* The user who's API keys you select should be a part of the same primary group as the user who will use the queries, though queries can be shared to other groups. 
* No specific user role is needed for this user, as any user can create queries or view plugin data.

## Requirements
* T.sc 5.13 or higher is required for [API key usage](https://docs.tenable.com/tenablesc/Content/GenerateAPIKey.htm)
* Docker; though technically you can run the script standalone (not supported).
* Internet access for the container to access the RSS feed of the cyber threat feed you're grabbing
* Network access to your T.sc instance over the UI/API interface (default is TCP 443)

## Usage

Run the container, passing your .env file to the container and specify the feed you want to use.
```
$ docker run --env-file .env vulnfeed_2_tenb --feed us-cert

### Supported Feeds
* [MS-ISAC](https://www.cisecurity.org/resources/advisory/?o=ms-isac&type=advisory) and [CIS](https://www.cisecurity.org/resources/advisory/?o=ms-isac&type=advisory)
    * Note, this is the same feed; you can specify either for different labels in Tenable.sc
* [US-CERT](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts)
* [ICS-CERT](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/advisories)
* [CERT](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/)
* [ACSC](https://www.cyber.gov.au/threats)

### Suggested operations
* Run the script on a scheduled basis; daily is likely frequently enough. The script checks for and should not create duplicates.
* If an advisory is released that specifies vulnerabilites that do not yet have published plugins, the script will check for and create a query when plugins do exist, as long as the advisory is still recent enough to be in the feed.
* Run the script multiple times with different feeds specified to get multiple feeds into Tenable.sc.

### Basic workflow under the hood
1. Script is called and a feed is specified
2. RSS of the specified feed is pulled, and relevant CVE data is pulled from all recent entries
3. If no CVEs are discarded in the feed, the entry is discarded.
4. Tenable.sc is queried to see if detection exists for the CVEs listed in the entry, if no detection, the entry is discarded.
5. Tenable.sc is queried to see if a Query already exists, if so, the entry is skipped.
6. A Query is created with the feed title and CVEs as filters.
